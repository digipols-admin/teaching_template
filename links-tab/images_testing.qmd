Rendering images can sometiems be tricky when dealing with path directories. In principle, there shouldn't be a problem as long as the path directory is correctly set. There are alternatives however. 

### The ULR Alternative

### Example

We can refer directly to the github

We can load the homepage image of this website, which is called `home3.png`, in these ways:

1. We could use the full URL path
```markdown
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digipols-admin/teaching_template/main/images/home3.png)
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/digipols-admin/teaching_template/main/images/home3.png)


2. Or html code
