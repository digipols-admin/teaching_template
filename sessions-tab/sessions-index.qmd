title: "Course sessions"
---

Each session in this course builds upon the previous, providing a learning approach that takes you from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Sessions 1, 2, and 3 are designed to be explored together, offering an introduction to the key tools and methods required for transforming data into visual insights. 

Further information on the course sessions will be added to the platform on a weekly basis.

## Sessions 1â€“3 Overview

Sessions 1 to 3 provide the foundation for transforming data into visual experiences. In these three sessions, you will:

- Understand the basics of data-driven communication and learn about the tools and workflows essential for effective content management.
- Explore survey creation using Google Forms and collaborative version control with GitHub to manage and streamline projects.
- Gain hands-on experience with RStudio and Quarto, mastering analytics and creating dashboards that communicate clear insights.

Together, these sessions set the stage for developing the practical skills needed to turn raw data into visual stories for marketing and communication purposes.

### Setting Up GitHub, R, and Quarto (Session 1)

As part of Session 1, you will set up the foundational tools needed for the course:

- **GitHub**: Learn the basics of version control, including creating repositories, committing changes, and collaborating on projects.
- **R and RStudio**: Configure R and RStudio, the primary tools for data analysis and visualization.
- **Quarto**: Set up Quarto to create dynamic and visually appealing reports and dashboards.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Session 1 Setup Guide](https://digipols-admin.github.io/teaching_template/sessions-tab/git_quarto_template.html).

### Surveys and Content Management (Sessions 2 & 3)

Sessions 2 and 3 are combined to provide an introduction to survey creation, data management, and basic dashboard design. Key topics include:

- **Real-World Dashboard Examples**: Explore real-world examples of dashboards that demonstrate diverse applications, some extending beyond survey data, to understand their practical impact.
- **Survey Design and Implementation**: Learn how to create and implement surveys using tools like Google Forms, focusing on effective question design and data collection.
- **Content Management with R**: Use R programming to import, clean, and wrangle data. This includes working with tools like `googlesheets4` to integrate and manipulate Google Sheets data efficiently.
- **Introduction to Dashboards**: Gain foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in creating basic dashboards, setting the stage for more advanced visualization techniques.

## Sessions 4 to 5/6 Overview

The final part of the course is dedicated to an Advanced Analysis session and presentations of Final Projects

### Advanced Analysis

Building on earlier meetings, the **Advanced Analysis** session will showcase some data analytics techniques, with a focus on sentiment analysis and text mining techniques for political and social media data. We will use real-world datasets to extract sentiment insights, apply classification techniques using large language models (LLMs) in R. 

### Final Project Guidelines

The final project constitutes a major part of the course assessment and is designed to allow students to integrate and apply the skills acquired throughout the course. The final project should focus on creating a compelling and insightful digital communication product in the form of a website. 

#### Project Objectives
By completing the final project, students will:  

- Use R and Quarto for content management and presention of data.

- Use the github version control and github Pages for website hosting  

- Develop an interactive and visually engaging data-driven communication project.

- Effectively communicate insights through a structured presentation.

#### Project Scope
Students will work independently to develop a project website based on a selected topic in marketing or communication. The project should incorporate the following elements:

1. **Data Processing & Analysis:**
   - Import data into R or create synthetic datasets.
   - Perform basic cleaning and transformation (e.g. using the `tidyverse` package).
   - Conduct descriptive and (optionally) sentiment analysis, depending on the project theme.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Create some key visualizations to support the narrative.
   - Consider using `ggplot2`, `ggpubr`, or interactive visualization libraries to enhance engagement.
   - Ensure clarity, aesthetics, and effective communication of insights.

3. **Final Presentation & Hosting:**
   - Develop a Quarto-based project website, integrating narrative text and visuals.
   - Deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**.
   
#### Project Submission Requirements
- A **GitHub repository** containing:
  - All R scripts used for data processing and visualization.
  - The Quarto project files.
- A **live GitHub Pages link** to the final project.
- A **short presentation (approx 10 minutes)** explaining key insights and design choices.

#### Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be assessed based on the following criteria:
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
