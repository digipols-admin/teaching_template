<p>This section demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data about Participatory Budgeting (PB). We’ll analyze tweets to understand how different social actors discuss PB and the emotional content of their messages.</p>
<p>We use R, Quarto, and the tidytext framework to score the sentiment of tweets with the AFINN lexicon. Then we explore the results with descriptive tables and basic charts.</p>
<p>The dataset covers tweets posted by a range of social actors (citizens, politicians, government agencies, etc.) and includes various grouping variable such as:</p>
<p><code>account_value</code>: Whether the Twitter account is run by an Individual or an Organisation.</p>
<p><code>actor_value</code>: The social actor type (e.g., Citizen, Administration, Media, etc.).</p>
<p><code>frame_value</code>: How the tweet frames participatory budgeting (e.g.&nbsp;in terms of Democracy, Justice, Resources or Problems).</p>
<p>A short codebook with more details on the data structure is in the Annex of this webpage.</p>
<section id="r-script" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="r-script">R Script</h2>
<p>All the steps for reading and cleaning the data, tokenizing text, and computing sentiment scores with the AFINN lexicon are included in an R script stored in the R folder of this project. This means you can run all those steps in your own Rstudio project (filename is <code>R/afinn_sentiment_analysis.R</code>) or with your own data by addapting the R scripts accordingly.</p>
<p>We will also compare traditional sentiment analysis using a dictionary approach (e.g.&nbsp;AFINN) with a Large Language Model (LLM) approach. To replicate the LLM approach covered in the class session, there is also an R script for running an LLM model on the Rstudio server, which can also be found in the project Repo (the path on the project repo is <code>R/mall_sentiment_classification.R</code>).</p>
<p>For replicating the AFINN approach, after running the script, a CSV file named <code>tw_sentiment_afinn.csv</code> should appear in your data/ folder. Make sure you have a folder called <code>data</code> in your project directory. The csv contains the original tweet data plus three extra columns:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>tweet_id: A simple numeric ID for each tweet.</p></li>
<li><p>sentiment_score: The numeric AFINN sentiment score per tweet (sum of word-level scores).</p></li>
<li><p>sentiment_category: A label of “Positive”, “Negative”, or “Neutral” based on sentiment_score.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The R script can also be accessed in the Annex of this document.</p>

<section id="which-frame-best-describes-the-tweet" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="which-frame-best-describes-the-tweet">Which “frame” best describes the tweet?</h3>
<p>[variable = <code>frame_value</code>] People who tweet about “participatory budgeting” (PB) present it in many different ways. They do this by emphasising (or neglecting to emphasise) particular aspects of PB. The way in which PB is “presented” and the impression it leaves on the reader of the tweet is referred to as “framing”. This question asks coders to consider how the topic of PB is “framed” in the tweet.</p>
<p>A tweet may contain an explicit frame. For instance, it may refer to PB in a positive way by emphasising citizen participation or by suggesting it is a fairer way to distribute a city budget. A tweet might also present PB in a negative way by explicitly pointing out that it is an inefficient way to allocate public funds or that it is subject to corruption.</p>
<p>A tweet may contain a frame even if that frame is not explicitly stated. Perhaps a tweet never explicitly states that, “PB is a fair way to distribute public goods” but if the tweet focuses on how PB funds are allocated then this is the kind of message transmitted to the reader.</p>
<p>Below we list the 7 of the most common frames we have identified related to PB. Each frame includes a short description and some examples of tweeets. We also include two extra answer options: “No frame”, where the tweet does not contain any identifiable frame, and “Other frame” for cases where the tweet’s frame does not fit any of the 7 predetermined categories.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Democratic solution</li>
<li>Political Empowerment</li>
<li>Improving accountability / transparency</li>
<li>Promote social justice</li>
<li>Resources / spending priorities</li>
<li>PB implementation problems</li>
<li>Negative aspects of PB Other frame No Frame</li>
</ol>
<p>In practice, the various frames were grouped together into simpler categories in the dataset <code>Democracy</code> (frames 1, 2, and 3) <code>Justice</code> (frame 4) <code>Resources</code> (frame 5) <code>Problems</code> (frames 6 and 7)</p>
