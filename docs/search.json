These tools are not only user-friendly but also highly adaptable to diverse research and business needs.\nIn this example, we will demonstrate the creation of a survey using Google Forms and the visualization of the collected data through Looker Data Studio. The dataset used is derived from the forcats package in R, specifically the General Social Survey on TV hours watched. This sample dataset will be used to create questionnaires and generate synthetic datasets for analysis and visualization.\nKey resources:\n\nExample of a Google survey form: A hands-on demonstration of survey design and implementation.\nExample of a Google Looker dashboard: A visual representation of survey data, highlighting key metrics and trends.\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nGoogle Forms Overview: Official Google forms support page.\nGetting Started with Google Data Studio: A good introduction to using Data Studio for data visualization."

Using the shinysurveys package in R, we will build a fully functional survey and collect responses dynamically. The collected data will then be showcased in both static and interactive reports using Quarto.\nShiny stands out as an excellent option for building enterprise-level web applications due to its flexibility and ability to handle dynamic data inputs. Its seamless integration with R makes it a popular choice for industries needing data-driven solutions, from finance to healthcare. Meanwhile, Quarto is emerging as a vanguard publishing solution, providing powerful tools for creating professional, high-quality documents and interactive reports. Its support for JavaScript Observable -as well as Python and VS Code- enhances interactivity, making it an ideal choice for creating engaging and exploratory data narratives.\nKey highlights:\n\nSurvey Creation: Learn to design surveys with Shiny and collect real-time data seamlessly.\nStatic Report: Present collected survey data in a clear and concise Quarto report, ideal for static dissemination.\nInteractive Report: Create an engaging interactive report using Quarto and JavaScript Observable, allowing users to explore the data dynamically.\n\nKey Resources:\n\niFrame example of a Shiny questionnaire hosted on demotec: A demonstration of hosting a Shiny survey.

The important aspect is to have a template in your github account that you can re-use at will.\nWe have prepared a template, so can avoid the process of creating a template. Although we do encourage you to create your own templates in github. For instance, you may want a template for creating online presentations, or scientific reports. Once you have a template repo in github, it’s very simply to push it to R.\nThese are the basic steps:\n\nStep 1: Clone a repo and make it a template\n\nClone a repo (a template for a Quarto website) from my personal github account: fmendez72/xdmcoms-website into your own github account\nIn your github account set the cloned repo as a “Template” [so you can re-use it]\nAssign the repo you just cloned a “Template” status and use it to create a github repo for a NEW quarto website\n\n\n\nStep 2: Pull the website into R\n\nPull the repo as a new R project\nBuild the website in R and push it to git\n\nThe video provides a step by step guide on how to do this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis video provides step by step guide. Remember to have your PAT password (the long one) and that you need to go to the Build tab in R in order to click on the “Render website” button. For changes to be reflected on your online website it is necessary to build the website.\n\n\nAlternatively, you can access the video directly: https://youtu.be/e8Cntd5Vv6E"

Key topics include:\n\nReal-World Dashboard Examples: Explore real-world examples of dashboards that demonstrate diverse applications, some extending beyond survey data, to understand their practical impact.\nSurvey Design and Implementation: Learn how to create and implement surveys using tools like Google Forms, focusing on effective question design and data collection.\nContent Management with R: Use R programming to import, clean, and wrangle data. This includes working with tools like googlesheets4 to integrate and manipulate Google Sheets data efficiently.\nIntroduction to Dashboards: Gain foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in creating basic dashboards, setting the stage for more advanced visualization techniques.\n\nFor additional resources and examples, visit the Surveys tab."
