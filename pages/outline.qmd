title: "Data-driven Communication: Content Management & Visualization for Marketing and Communication Sciences"
---

## Course Overview

This course emphasizes the practical, hands-on skills required to transform data into engaging digital experiences for marketing and communication contexts. Students will become familiar with the full technology stack—ranging from survey creation tools (Google Forms) and collaborative version control (GitHub) to R-based analytics (RStudio, Quarto) for generating clear and visually compelling dashboards. Rather than delving deeply into research theory, the focus is on equipping students to manage content and swiftly transform raw data into meaningful visual stories. By the end of the course, students will not only understand how to gather and analyze data but will also possess the technical know-how to host interactive visualizations online, making insights readily accessible for a variety of real-world scenarios.

### Prerequisites

To maximize learning outcomes, students are expected to have the following before starting the course:

1. **Very basic R knowledge**  
   - Familiarity with installing and running R scripts.  
   - Understanding of fundamental R operations, such as loading libraries and running basic commands.  
2. **R Setup**  
   - R and RStudio installed locally.  
   - While the course will primarily use a cloud-based R environment, local installations are encouraged for additional practice.  
3. **Google Account**  
   - A Google account is necessary to access and integrate tools like Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Google Drive via R packages (`googlesheets4`, `googledrive`).  
4. **GitHub Account**  
   - A GitHub account will be essential for hosting interactive visualizations online. Students are encouraged to sign up to GitHub in advance, i.e. have a username and password ready.
